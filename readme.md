This folder is meant to help me get my important configuration files set up on
new Linux machines. To install the config files, just run the "install.sh"
shell script.

The .tmux.conf file is one found here:
https://github.com/jekor/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf 

I modified it to give me the status that I want in the right-hand-side of the
status bar.
